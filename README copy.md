# PenguinTasker - Task Management System

PenguinTasker is a web-based task management system that allows users to organize their tasks, deadlines, and priorities in a fun and efficient way. With this application, users can register, log in, and access their personalized dashboard where they can manage their tasks with ease.

## Features

1. **User Registration and Authentication**: New users can create an account securely, and existing users can log in to access their tasks.

2. **Dashboard**: After logging in, users are greeted with a personalized dashboard that displays a list of their tasks, making it easy to keep track of their responsibilities.

3. **Add Task**: Users can quickly add new tasks by providing a title, description, and due date.

4. **View Tasks**: The dashboard provides a comprehensive list of all tasks, sorted by priority and due date, giving users a clear overview of their to-do list.

5. **Update Task**: Existing tasks can be easily edited and updated, allowing users to modify details such as title, description, or due date.

6. **Delete Task**: Users have the option to remove tasks from their list when they are no longer needed.

7. **Mark Task as Completed**: Completed tasks can be marked as such, moving them to a separate "Completed Tasks" section for better organization.

8. **Task Search**: A search functionality enables users to find specific tasks based on keywords.

## Technical Implementation

PenguinTasker is implemented using the following technologies:

1. **Front-end**: The user interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To enhance the UI, Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework, is employed.

2. **Back-end**: Flask, a Python web framework, is utilized to create the server-side application. It handles user authentication, task CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and task filtering.

3. **Database**: User information and task data are stored in a lightweight database such as SQLite. This approach avoids the use of ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) libraries to gain a deeper understanding of database interactions.

4. **Authentication and Sessions**: User authentication and session management are implemented to ensure secure login/logout functionality.

5. **RESTful API**: API routes follow RESTful principles to handle task CRUD operations effectively.

6. **Data Validation**: Proper validation of user input is enforced to prevent security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

7. **Testing**: Test cases are written to verify the functionality of the application and to cover edge cases.
